# ♻ ReWear – Re-Wear, Reuse, Reduce

## 🌍 Project Overview
*ReWear* is a simple yet powerful web platform designed to reduce textile waste by connecting people who want to donate used clothes with those who need them. In today’s fast-moving world, textile waste is increasing every second. ReWear aims to promote sustainability through easy and meaningful clothing donations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Tons of textiles are discarded every day, contributing to environmental damage. Many people are willing to donate usable clothes, but there is no proper platform to connect donors and receivers directly. ReWear solves this problem by creating a bridge between both parties.

## 💡 Key Features
- 📦 Users can list clothes they wish to donate.
- 🤝 Receivers can search and request available clothes.
- 📍 Location-based matching for easy pickups.
- 📝 Simple registration and clean user interface.
- 🔒 Secure and transparent user interactions.
- 📊 Track your contributions and impact.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. A user registers on the platform as a *donor* or a *receiver*.
2. Donors upload details about the clothes they wish to give.
3. Receivers browse the listings and connect with the donor.
4. After confirmation, they arrange for pickup or delivery.
5. Both users can track their donation history.
